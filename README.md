# stacking-boxes
This repo will hold a game made in Godot which is similar to both Tetris and Tricky Towers. The player will get a random object which they need to drop on a table or on other boxes in order to get as many points as possible. The objects and their collisions are physics-based. 

This project contains a full game cycle (Start menu, options, gameplay, end screen <highscore>) created with the help of good architecture and code quality

It follows programming principles such as:
 - Robustness
 - Scalibility
 - Modularity

Below you can find screenshots of the game:
